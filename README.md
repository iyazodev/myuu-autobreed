## Instructions

1. Install Node.js
2. Get Visual Studio Code
3. Create a new folder, open it in VSCode, then create a new javascript file within that folder
4. Run `npm i discord.js-selfbot-v13` in VSCode terminal
5. Copy + paste code from the index.js file into your javascript file 
6. Replace values in code with what you want: 
- Name of the pokemon you're breeding
- ID of channel to send messages in
- Number of box where the bred pokemon will go 
- The account token (at end of code)
7. Run + wait for results (eggs take around an hour to hatch)

## Notes

- Turn breeding notifications on
- Make sure you have unhatched eggs on your team and the daycare is able to produce new eggs
- The bot will only run commands when a new Pokemon is available in the daycare or when an egg has hatched, be patient
